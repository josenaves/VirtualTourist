# VirtualTourist

Udacity iOS NanoDegree project with maps and remote APIs and Core Data.

This app downloads and stores images from Flickr. It allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users are able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.
